### ✅ Task 2: Write Your First JavaScript Code
1. Create a new file: index.html.
2. Add a `<script>` tag inside the HTML file or link an external `script.js`.
3. Inside `script.js`, write a simple greeting program:
    ```js
    console.log("Hello, tapaScript!");
    console.log("Welcome to 40 Days of JavaScript!");
    document.write("Check the browser console for a message!");
    ```
4. Run the HTML file in the browser and check:
  - The console log prints the text.
  - The document.write() outputs text on the webpage.

### ✅ Task 3: Experiment with Different JavaScript Loading Methods
